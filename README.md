# Estimating the trend of COVID-19 in Norway by combining multiple surveillance indicators

Code for paper "Estimating the trend of COVID-19 in Norway by combining multiple surveillance indicators" available as a preprint here.

The repository includes the code and data to reproduce all the results in the paper. 

## Data

The data sources are described in the paper and the raw data is available in the data folder. The prepare_data.R file in this folder is used to import and clean the data.


## Code

* estimate_growth_rates.R  - Main file for estimating growth rates for all the indicators. Can run the estimates for different windown lenghts for the regression model
* meta_analysis.R - Combines the separate growth rates into one combined growth rate using a randome effects meta-analysis
* trend_models.R - Functions used in th other files
* plot_paper.R - Creates the plots used in the paper. Depends on the results files generated by estimate_growth_rates.R and meta_analys.R


To run the analysis first run estimate_growth_rates.R, then meta_analysis.R and then plot_paper.R. Figures will be greated in the paper/figures folder.
